# Asking questions
- Ask questions on the padlet [here](https://uofsussex.padlet.org/draman2/mcmcs-23-24-nobpvtdw6hzblkkg) 
- And in the lectures! Don't be shy. There is no stupid question. You are doing a favour for all other silent students who are thinking the same thing
- There will be time after the lectures to ask questions privately / in groups if you so desire

# Lectures
Please try and sit next to different people each week. I'll give you some time each lecture to introduce yourself. Why? 
- An important part of doing a degree is meeting people from different walks of life. Maybe you've made a friend!

- An important part of learning mathematics is getting insight into **other people's** thought processes. Work on the notebooks with people. Lots of people. Give advice on what you could do. Take advice on what you couldn't. 

# Notebooks
- It will take you **longer to complete the notebooks** than the time allotted in the labs. You need to work at home, or at the labs in your free time!

- You will have a **much easier time** if you do as much of the notebooks as possible **before the labs**!!!! That way, you can use the lab time usefully: asking questions to TAs, and discussing with other students. 

- **Don't** expect to completely answer every question. If you can, you're looking at a very high mark. Even if you can't, you can still get a good mark in the exam. But have a go at everything!

- Some questions will be **hard**. Others will be easy. Which ones? It's personal to you. Different people have different backgrounds. I **deliberately have not ranked the questions by difficulty**. I don't want you to immediately give up on things that are "*hard*".

- Answers are available. **Use them wisely**. The only person who loses from going to the answers without

# Most importantly

- What makes a good mathematician? A quality I call **relaxed, creative perserverance**: the ability to:
    - spend a lot of time on a question without getting anxious
    - **enjoy** the puzzling necessary for a tough question
    - have an **ironclad ego** that doesn't get anxious about asking stupid questions, or not being able to solve a question that others have
    - **not get in a hole** of repeatedly trying and failing at a particular way of answering the question (usually due to anxiety and/or self-defeating time constraints)


 - **Do not get frustrated or anxious if things seem hard**. Maths takes time to sink in. I've seen very good mathematicians take a lot of time to absorb "easy" content. Relaxed, creative perseverance is a much more important quality than speed.

 - And finally, as my old lecturer said:

 ## MATHS IS NOT A SPECTATOR SPORT

 - People often go to lectures, read answers, or listen to their friends, and leave with a pleasant sense of having understood the material. 
 - **THEY DO NOT**. You only understand mathematics when you **DO IT!!!!**. Hence the notebooks are by far the most important part of the material.
