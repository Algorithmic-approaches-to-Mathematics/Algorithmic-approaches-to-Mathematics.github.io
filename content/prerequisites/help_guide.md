# What to do when I encounter problems?

## By Paweł Piekarz (TA on the course)

At various times during the course, you will encounter different problems while working on the notebooks. That’s absolutely normal! You aren’t expected to already know and be able to do everything. Otherwise, why would you even be doing the course? Encountering challenges and making mistakes is a natural part of learning; however, to learn, you must overcome those obstacles. And sometimes it's hard to figure out how to do it, all by yourself.

## Obtaining help

The easiest way of getting some support is **discussing the problem with your peers**. You all have different strengths and weaknesses. Some other students might have already solved your problem or might be struggling with something you’ve done. Talk with people around you and help each other! Even if you don’t find a solution, discussing and brainstorming about it will help you understand it better.

Another easy way of obtaining guidance is going through the notebook before the labs, and **coming to the labs with prepared questions and problems.** Tutors are there to help you with any problems related to the topic. Asking them some prepared questions and presenting them with defined problems will also help them with helping you and allow you to spend more time on the labs focusing on other content. You can also **ask questions** about any challenges **during the labs** as you encounter them.

## Helping yourself

Problems during this module may come in different types. Sometimes the code might be giving you errors, doing things you weren’t expecting, and sometimes you might not know what to write or won’t understand what you’re meant to do on a conceptual level. If you can’t get help from others, it might often seem confusing and overwhelming. To make it easier, first, break down and identify what exactly is the problem you are having.

If you are **confused** about what’s going on **conceptually**, whether it’s about **writing code in Julia**, or about **mathematical foundations** of the material, you might need a review of the basics.  The [Mathematics Preliminaries](https://algorithmic-approaches-to-mathematics.github.io/prerequisites/mathematics-preliminaries/) page in [Prerequisites](https://algorithmic-approaches-to-mathematics.github.io/prerequisites/) tab contains references to courses covering most of the mathematical foundations of what’s going on, mostly on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math), as well as some computational courses. Enrico lists the most course-relevant topics and videos on that page. When it comes to Julia, [Think Julia](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html) is a free book that explains the basics pretty well in the first 3 chapters. The official [Julia Academy](https://juliaacademy.com/) contains many courses covering all topics from the basics to any advanced topics you would need. For any of you struggling with more advanced problems, [Introduction to Computational Thinking](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Fall23/) course is an excellent resource.

Sometimes you know what you want to do on a theoretical level, but you may find it difficult to **translate your ideas into code**. The easiest way is to break down what you are planning to do in small steps. Take a pen and some paper, and write down or draw a flowchart - your inputs, array sizes and so on. Plan out what you want to do with them, how to process which values, with which iterators or indices, step by step. Then following your schematics, write code to follow them step by step. Analogically, if your **code isn't doing what you think it should**, you can write down your inputs, and following your code step by step, manually check what the code is doing and where it gets wrong. You can automate this process by **debugging** - use *print* function to return values you want to check to see if they are what you expect, or when they go wrong.

Often, you will know what you want to do, but it won’t work – the code will throw **errors** or will do **something else than you expected**. In those cases, **Live docs** are your best friend. You can access them by clicking on them in the bottom right corner of your notebooks. Any in-built function or keyword you type or select will be explained there in real-time, with examples of its usage. Read how it works and compare the examples to how you have used it – should it work as you intended it to, or should you apply it differently? If you are looking for a function to do something, try typing what you think it's called - Live docs might suggest the actual name!

If knowledge of Julia, its syntax, and Live docs aren’t enough to help with errors, it might be time to check **online communities** for help. [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/julia), the official [Julia Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/) forum, and [r/Julia](https://www.reddit.com/r/Julia/) subreddit are very active and helpful. Most of the common problems you will encounter have already been discussed there and you should find the solutions just by searching for them. Generally, using Google or other search engine to look for a specific error message or describing the problem you are facing, should be enough to lead you to a thread with a detailed explanation of the solution.
