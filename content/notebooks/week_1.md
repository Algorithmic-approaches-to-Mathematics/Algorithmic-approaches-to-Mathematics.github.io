## Goals 

- Introduction to using programming to solve mathematical problems
- Expressing mathematics using both Julia and logical notation
- Understanding the *zoology* of mathematical and programmatic objects you will have to work with
- Introduction to the concept of a mathematically rigorous argument

## Resources

- [Think Julia](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html) is a great (online, freely available) textbook that will help consolidate your understanding. The following chapters will be useful background reading for this week (and may help with the exercises!!) 
    - [Chapter 1: The way of the program](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html#chap01)
    - [Chapter 2: Variables, Expressions, and Statements](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html#chap02)
    - [Chapter 3: Functions](https://benlauwens.github.io/ThinkJulia.jl/latest/book.html#chap03)

- Make sure you have read through the prerequisites. In particular
[Installation]({{< relref "/prerequisites/installation" >}} "About Us")

- Make sure you're happy with markdown syntax. It should take 5 minutes to get the hang of it. EG [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
