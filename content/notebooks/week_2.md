## References

- The topics introduced very briefly here are key to getting you to think like both a programmer and a mathematician.
- If you want to go further, read an amazing book: [Concrete Mathematics](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~r97002/temp/Concrete%20Mathematics%202e.pdf) by Ronald L. Graham, Donald E. Knuth, and Oren Patashnik. Donald Knuth is the inventor of LaTeX!
