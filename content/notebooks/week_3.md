## Goals 

- Introduction to linear algebra! A topic that is fundamental and you will encounter repeatedly on your journey. This week (long as it is) is just the start!


## Resources
- This is one of the most important notebooks. Even if you've done some linear algebra before, pay attention. Hopefully some things will be explained in a novel way to you.
- A great course on linear algebra is by 3blue1brown. You could go through it (excepting the sections on cross-products and Cramer's rule). This would put you in a great position for the rest of the module.
- Another good 'standard' course is [by Gil Strang](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video_galleries/video-lectures/).


## Challenging, skippable questions
#### (think of these questions as useful practice rather than core content)

- The questions on building clocks
- The question box about polynomials
- The example on linear image transformations, and all the associated questions. 
- The question box on the equivalence between abstract linear maps and matrices. It starts : *These questions assume vector spaces U...*

## Ensure you're happy with these concepts

- Understanding the dimensionality of tensors, and how to create (e.g. a 4d-tensor)
Understanding the following concepts:
- Vector spaces, the span of a vector space, the basis of a vector space
- Linear dependence of a vector on other vectors
- Matrix multiplication 
- The concept of a linear transformation and its properties
- Programming techniques seen in the answers. Particularly list comprehensions.
