## Goals 

- Introduction to linear algebra! A topic that is fundamental and you will encounter repeatedly on your journey. This week (long as it is) is just the start!


## Resources
- This is one of the most important notebooks. Even if you've done some linear algebra before, pay attention. Hopefully some things will be explained in a novel way to you.
- A great course on linear algebra is by 3blue1brown. You could go through it (excepting the sections on cross-products and Cramer's rule). This would put you in a great position for the rest of the module.
- Another good 'standard' course is [by Gil Strang](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/video_galleries/video-lectures/).
