# Notebook 9



<!-- {{< figure src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/matrix_transform.png" width="500" attr="Attribution: *xkcd 184*">}} -->

- This week the notebook is completely optional, and an extension of concepts in lectures.
- To reinforce the lectures, I've instead added a [lecture companion notebook](/Question_sheets/Week_9_companion.html), that goes through the working and plots of the examples in the lectures.
