I can't embed the lectures in this website. They are password protected. But I'll put the canvas links here.

[Week 1 slides](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/27206/files?preview=4280552) & [Week 1 recording](https://sussex.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=9f900b8d-e553-4023-adac-b091010a00fb)

[Week 2](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/27206/files?preview=4292544) & [Week 2 recording](https://sussex.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=f08f4939-99da-4e08-9278-b09801095eb4#)

Further reading for those interested includes:
- [Performance tips](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/)
- [Deeper thoughts on memory management in Julia (and in general)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M2i7sSRcSIw)
- [Jax (JIT compiled Numpy with many extra goodies)](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html)

[Week 3](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/27206/files?preview=4307068) & [Week 3 recording](https://sussex.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=096cdc9b-ed4f-415d-a56d-b09f0108978b)

[Week 4](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/27206/files?preview=4310915) & [Week 4 recording](https://sussex.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=56f8f7e4-2084-49e8-9a73-b0a6010983a2)


- Alternatively/additionally check out the excellent [3blue1brown videos](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/linear-algebra) on linear algebra. Skip the videos on cross products and Cramer's rule.

[Week 5](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/27206/files?preview=4324242) & [Week 5 recording](https://sussex.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=eee1cc6b-aa96-4b65-b8ce-b0ad0119d610)

- [More insight](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/pdfs) on zero probability events and probability density functions

[Week 6](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/27206/files?preview=4339122) & [Week 6 recording](https://sussex.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=b0a1e3a8-fc2e-489d-a0fa-b0b40118f432)

Some links on reading mathematics that I thought were good: (there are lots online, of variable quality)

- [Two page summary](https://pi.math.cornell.edu/~hubbard/readingmath.pdf)
- [The top google result](https://web.stonehill.edu/compsci/history_math/math-read.htm) (which I nevertheless thought was insightful)

Some links on probability from, as usual, 3blue1brown. The [overall course is here](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/probability). I recommend watching the entire thing if you have time and want to best understand probability. We couldn't cover all the basic topics in probability theory due to time constraints, so here are some videos particularly relevant to the lectures of the last two weeks:

- [Central limit theorem intuition](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/clt)
- [More central limit theorem intuition](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/gaussian-convolution)
- [Bayes theorem](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/bayes-theorem)
- [Zero probability events are not impossible](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/pdfs)

[Week 7](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/27206/files?preview=4357193) & [Partial recording (slides)](https://sussex.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=34113202-9759-401b-a535-b0bb011a5e64) & [Partial recording (audio and room view)](https://sussex.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=802bb997-6718-41a3-babc-b0bb011a5a02)

- Panopto wasn't fully working on the main screen this week, so the slides aren't visible on the room view recording. Instead, I also did a simultaneous recording on my laptop. 

- Week 7 had a lot of content. A static, 1hr lecture is not the best way to parse it. I encourage you to watching the following videos, which have animations of the concepts, and collectively don't take much longer than an hour. **Collectively, they cover all of week 7**

- [Basics of derivatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vKqVkMQHKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr&index=2)
- [Derivative formulas for basic functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0_qX4VJhMQ&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr&index=3) (this is less important)
- [Chain and product rule](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG15m2VwSjA&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr&index=4)
- [Higher order derivatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLkz5LGWihw&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr&index=10)

We talked about multivariable calculus at the end. This is hard to get your head around. If you're struggling with the previous concepts, leave it. Better to spend your time understanding the above fully. If you'd like to go for it, look below:

- [Multivariable functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrcCbdWwCBc&t=1s)
- [Partial derivatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXqhWeUEtQU) 
- [Visualising partial derivatives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfvnCHqzK54&list=PLSQl0a2vh4HC5feHa6Rc5c0wbRTx56nF7&index=16)
- [Partial derivatives 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdMep5GUOBw&list=PLSQl0a2vh4HC5feHa6Rc5c0wbRTx56nF7&index=17)

[Week 8](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/27206/files?preview=4375352) & [Recording](https://sussex.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=b3d083f8-52d8-4976-a872-b0c20119eb4b)

[Week 9]()

[Week 10]()

 [Test canvas link](https://sussex.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Auth/Login.aspx?Auth=SessionView&ReturnUrl=%2fPanopto%2fPages%2fViewer.aspx%3fid%3d4cdfc937-14d6-4587-92da-af6200d7b643) seems to work
